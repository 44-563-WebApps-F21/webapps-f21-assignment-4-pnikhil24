    ACT II. _Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_.
</h5>
<h5>
    [LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
    armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
    _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
    _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]

</h5>

<p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech lord">Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?</p>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech lord">LORD GORING. [_Taking off his left-hand glove_.] What a pity! I beg
    your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that. But if what you
    tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
    Lady Chiltern.</p>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. It would be quite useless.</p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <h6 class="speech lord">LORD GORING. May I try?</h6>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.</p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <h6 class="speech lord">LORD GORING. Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
    experiment.</h6>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <h6 class="speech lord">LORD GORING. Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so,
    life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
    you should have told her years ago.</h6>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. When? When we were engaged? Do you think she
    would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
    such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
    a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?</p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <h6 class="speech lord">LORD GORING. [_Slowly_.] Yes; most men would call it ugly names. There
    is no doubt of that.</h6>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert"> SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [_Bitterly_.] Men who every day do something of
    the same kind themselves. Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
    in their own lives.</p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <h6 class="speech lord">LORD GORING. That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
    people’s secrets. It distracts public attention from their own.</h6>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did? No
    one.</p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <h6 class="speech lord">LORD GORING. [_Looking at him steadily_.] Except yourself, Robert.</h6>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert">  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [_After a pause_.] Of course I had private
    information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
    the day, and I acted on it. Private information is practically the
    source of every large modern fortune.</p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <h6 class="speech lord">LORD GORING. [_Tapping his boot with his cane_.] And public scandal
    invariably the result.</h6>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert">  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [_Pacing up and down the room_.] Arthur, do you
    think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up
    against me now? Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be
    ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost? I was twenty-two at the
    time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
    unforgiveable things nowadays. Is it fair that the folly, the sin of
    one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
    mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have
    worked for, all that I have built up. Is it fair, Arthur?</p>
    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <h6 class="speech lord">  LORD GORING. Life is never fair, Robert. And perhaps it is a good thing
    for most of us that it is not.</h6>
    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN</h6>
    <p class="speech robert">  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Every man of ambition has to fight his century with
    its own weapons. What this century worships is wealth. The God of this
    century is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all costs one
    must have wealth</p>
